## Features

- Convenient, launched with a single command.
- Lightweight, less than 5 MB.
- No docker, just a single binary.
- No database, storing all configurations in zerotier working directory(`*.ext.json`).

## Quick start

1. Install Zerotier-Edge.

   Download `Zerotier-Edge` from [here](https://github.com/mokeyish/zerotier-edge/releases) then unzip it.

2. Launch service

   ```shell
   ./zerotier-edge
   ```

   Note: `./zerotier-edge --help` will show the help of command.

3. Access Web UI to manage your controller.

   1. Open [http://127.0.0.1:9394/](http://127.0.0.1:9394/) on your browser.
   2. Login with token ([How to get your token?](https://docs.zerotier.com/self-hosting/network-controllers/#authtoken))
   3. Manage your controller.

4. Configure remote access (optional)

   It is recommended to enable https in Nginx and then proxy our service.

   ```nginx
   location /zerotier-edge/ {
        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:9394/;
   }
   ```

Note：I don't want to use heavyweight deployment based on Docker/Nodejs. So I created this project.
